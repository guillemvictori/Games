//1024
-I'm sure that this is a bit complex code because when I programmed 1024 I didn't know about classes. Anyways the most important thing in this game is the main algorithm, not the way that this is graphically implemented.

-The game is programmed with CodeBlocks in C++, the main file is 1024.cbp (codeblocks file project).

-And make sure the box "Have g++ follow the C++11 ISO C++ language standard [-std=c++11]" is checked (Toolbar -> Settings -> Compiler)

//Snake

-The oriniray idea about the main algorithm, is from Pau Fernandez. But the whole develop is mine. It was just an exercice to improve my C++ skills.

-The game is programmed with CodeBlocks in C++, the main file is snake.cbp (codeblocks file project).


//Rubik files

- About the files named "Rubik" are some files from a not finished Unity project ( in C#), the main idea is good in my opinion, but I had some problems with the rottions, and nowadays the project is paused.
